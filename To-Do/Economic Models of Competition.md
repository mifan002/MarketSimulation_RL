# Market Structure
## 1. Category
- 4 types: perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, oliopoly
- definition, tabular demonstration and stuffs

### 1.1 perfect competition
This is one of the most fundamental models in economics and serves as a benchmark against which other, more realistic market structures are compared. It is often used in basic economic analysis and in teaching introductory economics.

### 1.2 monopoly

### 1.3 monopolistic competition
- This model assumes that many firms compete on product differentiation rather than price. Each firm makes a unique product and faces a downward-sloping demand curve. Firms in monopolistic competition have some degree of market power, but entry and exit are relatively easy, which limits the extent of this power.
- This model is popular in situations where products are differentiated, such as in the retail industry. It is also used to study industries where firms have some degree of market power.

### 1.4 oligopoly
- This is a market structure in which a small number of firms have the large majority of market share. An oligopoly is similar to a monopoly, but rather than one firm, two or more firms dominate the market. There is no precise upper limit to the number of firms in an oligopoly, but the number must be low enough that the actions of one firm significantly influence the others.
- This model is used to study markets that are dominated by a small number of firms. It is particularly relevant in industries like telecommunications, where there are high barriers to entry and a small number of firms serve the entire market.

## 2. Oligopoly Models
### Cournot
- Named after Antoine Augustin Cournot, this model assumes that firms compete on the quantity of output they produce, rather than price. Each firm chooses its output level assuming that the other firms' output levels will remain constant. The equilibrium is reached when no firm wants to change its output level given the output levels of the other firms.
- This model is widely used in industrial organization to analyze situations where firms compete in quantities. It is particularly relevant in industries where firms make simultaneous decisions about production levels.

#### Assumption
- firms compete over quantities

### Stackelberg
Named after Heinrich Freiherr von Stackelberg, this model is a more dynamic form of Cournot competition. In a Stackelberg competition, one firm is considered the market leader and makes its output decision first. The other firms, known as followers, observe the leader's output decision and then make their own decisions.

### Bertrand
- This model is used when firms compete in prices. It is often used to analyze price competition in industries with differentiated products.
